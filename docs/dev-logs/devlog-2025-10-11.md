# Developer Log â€” 2025-10-11

## Summary

- Added session lifecycle runbooks (`runbooks/session_kickoff.md`, `runbooks/session_closure.md`).
- Hardened `context_delta` appender to validate-before-commit (prevents dirty writes).
- Cleaned a malformed delta entry and re-appended a valid runbooks delta.
- Sanity: `python3 scripts/validate_context_delta.py` returns exit 0.

## Decisions

- Standardize session open/close via runbooks to reduce context drift.
- Keep deltas append-only with schema validation before commit.

## Risks / Issues

- Adherence drift to runbooks during busy sessions.

## Next Steps

- Add a pre-commit check to ensure runbooks exist and are linked in README.
- Extend smoke tests to cover `/api/llm/v1/chat/completions` streaming.
- Tighten CORS to `https://amara.bodyhigh.com`.
