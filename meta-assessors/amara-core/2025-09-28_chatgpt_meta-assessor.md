## Meta-Assessor — Amara Core — Sprint N (v0.1.0 baseline)

### Comparative Framing

- Currently only **ChatGPT Assessor Synthesis** available.
- No cross-Assessor divergences or bias yet measurable.

### Strengths by Assessor

- **ChatGPT Assessor**:
  - Clear prioritization buckets (Immediate, Next Sprint, Longer-term).
  - Strong mapping to guardrails and roadmap.
  - Balanced focus on infra stability, security, and testing.

### Weaknesses & Blind Spots

- Lack of multi-platform perspective; no way to triangulate biases or blind spots.
- Potential overemphasis on infra hardening vs. user-facing readiness.

### Complementarity & Overlap

- N/A — additional assessor inputs (Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek) required.

### Meta-Synthesis

- Use ChatGPT Assessor as **baseline synthesis**.
- Expect future Assessors to contribute:
  - Gemini → more product/UX-oriented findings.
  - Claude → more process/organizational insights.
  - DeepSeek → more performance/efficiency angles.

### Recommendations for Future Use

- Gather at least **2 more Assessor runs** (e.g., Gemini + Claude) before next sprint close.
- When comparing, focus on:
  - Divergent prioritizations (e.g., risk vs. velocity tradeoffs).
  - Bias detection (LLM tendency to favor process vs. code vs. infra).
- Feed overlaps into **Quick Wins** list for next sprint planning.
